        <p>
        A lot of people suffer from back and neck pain. The pain can have numerous reasons, it is not the goal of this article to go over all of them. We would like to focus on a reason that is very common: back pain because of prolonged sitting at our desks and computers. The following picture gives you some insight in how the pressure on the disc varies with posture.
        </p>

        <p>
        Sitting exerts large pressure on the discs in our spine. When this pressure is applied for too long the discs become weak and kindle. The amount of pressure on the disc is in function of how people sit. Sitting in a bad position increases the pressure even more. Why people sit in a bad position can have several reasons:

        <ul>
          <li>it is very hard to maintain the right posture for a long period at a time</li>
          <li>people don’t often know what a good posture is</li>
          <li>they don’t have the furniture that helps them to achieve a good posture</li>
          <li>and even if you could attain that posture it is still not healthy to be in the same position for long</li>
        </ul>


        <p>
          As seen on the picture above, standing upright doesn’t exert as much pressure on the discs as sitting which proofs the main point of the article. People should stand, sit, lie down and change positions throughout the day. This releases  pressure on the discs and activates the big muscle groups that in turn take away pressure from the discs and bones.

        <p>
          So a standing desk, if you implement and use it in the right way can indeed be good for your back.

          Quick wrap up:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>standing takes away pressure from the discs in-between your spine</li>
          <li>a standing desk makes you move around more if implemented correctly which activates big muscles groups that take pressure of even more</li>
        </ul>
