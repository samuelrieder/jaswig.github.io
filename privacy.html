      <h2><strong>1. Why this Privacy Statement?</strong></h2>
      <p>Every person who visits or uses the Website (hereafter the “User”) will almost inevitably disclose a certain amount of personal data. The personal data is information which allows JASWIG to identify you as a natural person, regardless of whether we actually do this. You are identifiable as soon as it is possible to create a direct or indirect link between one or more data and you as a natural person. </p>
      <p>We only use and process your personal data in accordance with the GDPR and any replacement legislation, or any similar regulation under any applicable law, and any regulatory requirements or codes of practice governing the use, storage or transmission of personal data. Every reference in this Privacy Statement to the ‘GDPR’ is a reference to the Regulation of 27 April 2016 on the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of such Data (General Data Protection Regulation).</p>
      <p>Through this Privacy Statement, every User is informed of the processing activities JASWIG may carry out with his or her personal data. JASWIG reserves the right to modify this Privacy Statement at all times. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Statement, we will notify you by posting the new version of the Privacy Policy on the Website or may send each User a courtesy email. It is your responsibility to check the Website for updates to this Privacy Statement.

      <h2><strong>2. Who is responsible for the processing of your personal data?</strong></h2>
      <h3><strong>2.1 Data Controller</strong></h3>

      <h3><strong>2.2 Data Processor(s)</strong></h3>
      <p>JASWIG is free to rely on data processors for the processing of your personal data. A processor is the natural or legal person who processes your personal data upon request and on behalf of the data controller. Each data processor is required to ensure the security and confidentiality of the data. The data processor shall always act on the instructions of the data controller.</p>

      <li>Companies we have engaged for payment purposes.</li>
      </ul>

      <li>On the basis of our legitimate interest in sending information and newsletters to our customers;</li>
      <li>On the basis of your consent to send promotional offers (direct marketing). </li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h2><strong>4. Which personal data is being processed?</strong></h2>
      <p>The personal data of Users is collected when they fill out a contact form on our Website or when they complete our online ordering method.</p>
      <p>JASWIG commits to only collect and process your personal data in a way that is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. The following categories of personal data are processed by JASWIG:

      <li>Financial identification data (bank details);</li>
      <li>Any other personal data you send us by e-mail, via the contact form or via our online chat (e.g. a CV).</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>We also use cookies in order to recognise the returning visitor of our Website and to offer every User a personalised user experience, to remember technical choices (e.g. a shopping cart), and to detect and correct any errors which might be present on the Website.</p>
      <p>For more information concerning the use of cookies, we kindly refer you to our Cookie Policy [URL].</p>

      <h2><strong>5. For which purposes is your personal data being used?</strong></h2>
      <p>JASWIG collects your personal data for the sole purpose of offering every User of our a safe, optimised and personal user experience of our Website and the offered services. The collection of personal data becomes more extensive as the User makes more intensive use of our Website and our online services. JASWIG reserves the right to suspend or cancel certain operations if personal data is missing, incorrect or incomplete.</p>
      <p>The processing of your personal data is essential for the proper functioning of the Website and the provision of associated services. JASWIG commits to solely process your personal data for the following purposes:
        <ul>
      <li>Allowing Users to make purchases via our Website;</li>
      <li>Customer management: customer administration, account management, invoicing, customer support, complaint monitoring and sending newsletters;</li>
      <li>Answering and following up on questions which are asked via the chat functionality on our Website, in a way that is clear, relevant and to the point;</li>
      <li>Dispute management;</li>
      <li>To detect and offer protection against all fraud, errors and criminal behaviours on the Website.</li>
      <li>Personalized marketing and advertising if you have expressly agreed to it. In that case, you are free to withdraw your consent at any time. </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>When visiting the website of JASWIG, some data is being collected for statistical purposes. Such data is necessary to optimise your user experience. These data are: IP-address, probable location of consultation, hour and day of the consultation and the pages which are being consulted. When you visit the Website, you explicitly agree to this collection of data for statistical purposes. </p>
      <p>We do not, under any circumstances, collect sensitive personal information, such as information about your race, political opinions, health, religious or other beliefs, sexual orientation, etc.</p>
      <p>The User provides the personal data to JASWIG himself and therefore retains a certain degree of control. When certain personal data is incomplete or apparently incorrect, JASWIG has the right to postpone some expected actions temporarily or permanently.</p>

      <h2><strong>6. Who receives your personal data?</strong></h2>
      <p>Your personal data is processed for internal use within JASWIG only. Your personal data will not be sold, passed on or communicated to any third parties, except in case you have given us your explicit prior consent or in case the transmission is necessary for the performance of the contract or is legally required.</p>
      <p>As a resident of the European Economic Area, a transfer of your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) can only take place to countries that the Data Protection Authority in Belgium has found to provide the same adequate level of protection or, if this is not the case, to the extent that JASWIG has made the necessary contractual arrangements, taking into account the standard provisions as imposed by the Data Protection Authority in Belgium, to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection.</p>
      <p>In particular, we rely on data processors located in the United States. However, we will only use processors who comply with the obligations of the EU-US Privacy Shield and who have formally complied with these obligations.</p>

      <h2><strong>7. Who receives your personal data?</strong></h2>
      <p>Your personal data is stored as long as necessary to achieve the purposes pursued. Your personal data will be erased from our database as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purposes pursued or if you validly exercise your right to erasure.</p>

      <h2><strong>8. Who receives your personal data?</strong></h2>
      <h3><strong>8.1 Guarantee of a legitimate and secure process of your personal data</strong></h3>
      <p>Your personal data is always processed for the legitimate purposes explained in point 5. Your personal data is collected and processed in an appropriate, relevant and non-excessive manner, and is not kept longer than necessary to achieve the intended purposes.</p>
      <h3><strong>8.2 Right to access</strong></h3>
      <p>If you can prove your identity, you have the right to obtain information about the processing of your data. Thus, you have the right to know the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the categories of recipients to whom the personal data is transmitted, the criteria used to determine the data retention period, and the rights that you can exercise with regard to your personal data. </p>
      <h3><strong>8.3 Right to rectification of your personal data</strong></h3>
      <p>naccurate or incomplete personal data may be corrected. It is primarily the responsibility of the User to notify us of any updates or changes regarding his personal information, but you can also request us in writing.</p>
      <h3><strong>8.4 Right to erasure (or “right to be forgotten”) </strong></h3>
      <p>You also have the right to obtain the erasure of your personal data under the following assumptions:
        <ul>
      <li>Your personal data are no longer necessary for the intended purposes;</li>
      <li>You withdraw your consent to the processing and there is no other legal ground for processing;</li>
      <li>You have validly exercised your right of opposition;</li>
      <li>Your personal data has been illegally processed;</li>
      <li>Your personal data must be deleted to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The deletion of data is mainly related to visibility; it is possible that the deleted data are still temporarily stored.</p>
      <h3><strong>8.5 Right to limitation of processing</strong></h3>
      <p>In certain cases, you have the right to request the limitation of the processing of your personal data, especially in case of dispute as to the accuracy of the data, if the data are necessary in the context of legal proceedings or the time required to JASWIG to verify that you can validly exercise your right to erasure.</p>
      <h3><strong>8.6 Right to object</strong></h3>
      <p>You have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. JASWIG will stop processing your personal data unless it can demonstrate that there are compelling legitimate reasons for the processing which prevail over your right to object.</p>
      <h3><strong>8.7 Right to data portability</strong></h3>
      <p>You have the right to obtain any personal data which you have provided us in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format. At your request, this data may be transferred to another provider unless it is technically impossible.</p>
      <h3><strong>8.8 Right to withdraw your consent</strong></h3>
      <p>You may withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data at any time, for example for direct marketing purposes.</p>

      <h2><strong>9. How to exercise my rights?</strong></h2>
      <p>If you wish to exercise your rights, you must send a written request and proof of identity by registered mail to JASWIG BVBA, Provenierstrersstraat 15, B- 9000 Gent, Belgium or by email to <a href="mailto:standup@jaswig.eu">standup@jaswig.eu</a>. We will respond as soon as possible, and no later than one (1) month after receipt of the request.</p>

      <h2><strong>10. Possibility to lodge a complaint</strong></h2>
      <p>If you are not satisfied with the processing of your personal data by JASWIG, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent Data Protection Authority (for Belgium: <a href="https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be/">https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be/</a>").</p>

        <h2><strong>1. Cookies</strong></h2>
        <p>A cookie is a small text file that is placed on the hard disk of your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. The cookie is placed on your device by the website itself ("first party cookies") or by partners of the website ("third party cookies"). The cookie identifies your device by a unique identification number when you return to the website and collects information about your browsing behaviour.</p>
        <p>There are different types of cookies. We distinguish the following cookies according to their purposes: there are essential or strictly necessary cookies and non-essential cookies (functional, analytical and targeting cookies).</p>
        <p>The Belgian Act concerning the Electronic Communication of 13 June 2005 contains some provisions about cookies and the use thereof on websites. The Belgian implementation is deduced of the European e-Privacy Directive, which implies that the cookie usage and the cookie legislation is regulated differently in every European country. JASWIG is a Belgium-based webshop and therefore adheres to the Belgian and European legislation on cookies.</p>

        <h2><strong>2. Goals and utilities of cookies</strong></h2>
        <p>By using the website, the visitor may agree to the use of cookies. Cookies help JASWIG to optimize your visit to the website and to provide you with an optimal user experience.

        <h2><strong>3. Types of cookies used by Jaswig</strong></h2>
        <p>We distinguish the following types of cookies, according to their purposes:</p>
        <p>- <strong>Essential / Strictly necessary cookies: </strong></p>
        <p>These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be disabled in our systems. They are usually only set up in response to your actions, such as setting up your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. They are necessary for a good communication and they facilitate navigating (for example, returning to a previous page, etc.).</p>
        <p>- <strong>Non-essential cookies:</strong></p>
        <p>These cookies are not necessary for the website to function, but they do help us to offer an improved and personalized website.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Functional cookies:</strong><br><br>These cookies enable the website to offer improved functionality and personalization. They can be set up by us or by external providers whose services we have added to our pages.</li>
          <li><strong>Analytical cookies:</strong><br><br>With these cookies, we can track visits and traffic so that we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to determine which pages are the most and the least popular and how visitors move through the site.</li>
          <li><strong>Targeting / advertising cookies:</strong><br><br>These cookies can be set by ourselves or by our advertising partners via our site. They can be used to create a profile of your interests and show you relevant ads on other sites.</li>
