      <h2><strong>Rights as a data subject</strong></h2>
      <p>Every user can be assured that his personal data will be processed in a fair and lawful manner. The personal data will only be processed for the legitimate purposes that have been described above. Jaswig guarantees that the processing will always be sufficient, proportionate and not excessive.<br><br>
      Wether you buy from us, or you subscribe to our newsletter your data is always handled with care. Following the General Data Protection Regulation we’ve updated our programs and systems to comply with this legal framework. For the customers the following things change under the GDPR legislation. So if you want to know what it is all about, have a look here. <br><br>
      Within GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) one needs to choose a lawful basis on which we can collect data. For the personal data that we gather we use the lawful basis “consent”. As to ship you the goods you bought at our store, or provide you with the information you would like to receive by subscribing to our email subscription list we clearly ask you to fill in forms where you have to fill in all the information yourself thereby giving your consent to give us this information.<br><br>
      Having consent as a lawful basis also means that the right to object and to withdraw consent are applicable to the info you provide us. Other rights that you have are also described in the following enumeration:<br><br>
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Right to object and the right to withdraw consent.</li>
      <li>Right of portability: Send us an email and we’ll securely export all your data into a .CSV file.</li>
      <li>Right of access: we’ve updated our privacy on how we use and manage our data. Visit our privacy policy here.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>To update the information retained about you please send us an email with the the information you would like to update. We will have a look at your current information and chance the things that have changed.<br><br>
      To protect your privacy and security, we will also verify your identity before granting access or making corrections by checking the email address and or contacting you via phone to check if it is really you.<br><br>
      If you do not want us to use your information for third party marketing purposes, or if you wish to adjust any other preferences please contact us at the address detailed in this document or on our website under “contact us”. <br><br>
      Each user can oppose the processing of his personal data. This right to object exists only if there are sufficient legitimate and weighty grounds relating to his particular situation. The exceptions provided in article 5, (b) and (c) of the Privacy Act are also applicable to this right to object. The user may at any time, free of charge and without further ado oppose the proposed processing of your personal data if those data were obtained for the purpose of direct marketing.<br><br>
      Jaswig attaches a great importance to an accurate data collection. Inaccurate or incomplete personal data can therefore always be improved or even obliterated. Because it is impossible for us to continuously be aware of any mistakes, incompleteness or falseness of your personal data, it is up to the user to report inaccuracies or omissions and to perform the necessary adjustments regarding ones registration details. <br><br>
      The User must apply the rights if desirable. The user shall exercise his right through a signed, written request to Jaswig, by post or e-mail to standup@jaswig.eu.  Jaswig undertakes the appropriate action within fifteen (15) working days following a request.
