      <h2><strong>1. Why this Privacy Statement?</strong></h2>
      <p>Every person who visits or uses the Website (hereafter the “User”) will almost inevitably disclose a certain amount of personal data. The personal data is information which allows JASWIG to identify you as a natural person, regardless of whether we actually do this. You are identifiable as soon as it is possible to create a direct or indirect link between one or more data and you as a natural person. </p>
      <p>We only use and process your personal data in accordance with the GDPR and any replacement legislation, or any similar regulation under any applicable law, and any regulatory requirements or codes of practice governing the use, storage or transmission of personal data. Every reference in this Privacy Statement to the ‘GDPR’ is a reference to the Regulation of 27 April 2016 on the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of such Data (General Data Protection Regulation).</p>
      <p>Through this Privacy Statement, every User is informed of the processing activities JASWIG may carry out with his or her personal data. JASWIG reserves the right to modify this Privacy Statement at all times. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Statement, we will notify you by posting the new version of the Privacy Policy on the Website or may send each User a courtesy email. It is your responsibility to check the Website for updates to this Privacy Statement.

      <h3><strong>2.2 Data Processor(s)</strong></h3>
      <p>JASWIG is free to rely on data processors for the processing of your personal data. A processor is the natural or legal person who processes your personal data upon request and on behalf of the data controller.

      <p>For more information concerning the use of cookies, we kindly refer you to our Cookie Policy [URL].</p>

      <h2><strong>5. For which purposes is your personal data being used?</strong></h2>
      <p>JASWIG collects your personal data for the sole purpose of offering every User of our a safe, optimised and personal user experience of our Website and the offered services.

JASWIG reserves the right to suspend or cancel certain operations if personal data is missing, incorrect or incomplete.</p>
      <p>The processing of your personal data is essential for the proper functioning of the Website and the provision of associated services. JASWIG commits to solely process your personal data for the following purposes:

      <h2><strong>6. Who receives your personal data?</strong></h2>
      <p>Your personal data is processed for internal use within JASWIG only. Your personal data will not be sold, passed on or communicated to any third parties, except in case you have given us your explicit prior consent or in case the transmission is necessary for the performance of the contract or is legally required.</p>
      <p>As a resident of the European Economic Area, a transfer of your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) can only take place to countries that the Data Protection Authority in Belgium has found to provide the same adequate level of protection or, if this is not the case, to the extent that JASWIG has made the necessary contractual arrangements, taking into account the standard provisions as imposed by the Data Protection Authority in Belgium, to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection.</p>
      <p>In particular, we rely on data processors located in the United States. However, we will only use processors who comply with the obligations of the EU-US Privacy Shield and who have formally complied with these obligations.</p>

      <h2><strong>7. Who receives your personal data?</strong></h2>
      <p>Your personal data is stored as long as necessary to achieve the purposes pursued. Your personal data will be erased from our database as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purposes pursued or if you validly exercise your right to erasure.</p>

      <h3><strong>8.2 Right to access</strong></h3>
      <p>If you can prove your identity, you have the right to obtain information about the processing of your data.

      <p>In certain cases, you have the right to request the limitation of the processing of your personal data, especially in case of dispute as to the accuracy of the data, if the data are necessary in the context of legal proceedings or the time required to JASWIG to verify that you can validly exercise your right to erasure.</p>
      <h3><strong>8.6 Right to object</strong></h3>
      <p>You have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes.

      <p>You have the right to obtain any personal data which you have provided us in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format. At your request, this data may be transferred to another provider unless it is technically impossible.</p>
