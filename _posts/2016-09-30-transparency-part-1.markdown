### Why we want to be transparent and what we hope to achieve with it

The world around us is very complicated but maybe it doesn’t have to be that way?! We would like to experiment with full transparency to make the reality we are building around us more digestible.
<!--more-->

One thing I learned to run human systems is transparency. Transparent organizations are more powerful. They much open because of their transparency. As a consequence they are much more collaborative this means they are also less top down and heirarchical and more connected in rich relationships of people that try to get their work done.

We hope to achieve the following things by choosing this radically different way of working:

* Get as much feedback as possible on important issues that would otherwise be impossible.
* Show the people how much interesting decisions we have to make so they can learn together with us.
* Have the best possible bond with our community (because that is what makes us thrive).
* Keep us lean and agile!
* Share with the community and inspire, we don’t say that we are the ones doing everything right (quite the contrary) but we can all actually learn a lot from what people do wrong as well. Next to that we really believe we should dare to inspire even if the only thing you would get from it is how not to do it ☺!


### Masterplan

So what is our master plan? How do we want to grow towards full transparency? Because it as the title suggests it will be a process, not a one-time effort.

All the topics that we would like to share eventually are (the list might get bigger in the future if we forget something):

* where and by whom our products are made
* how much they cost us (-> so how much we are making on each and every desk we sell)
* what we have as overhead,
* how much we earn,
* which overhead we have,
* how the shares are distributed
* who is in charge of which piece of the Jaswig machine ☺
* the books we read
* the programs we use to be more productive
* …

## Transparent Pricing

Today we would like to start with: Transparent pricing!

We want to make all the posts as visually attractive as possible so we would like to present the different costs of the different parts in the following info graphic.

## Other companies that are pushing the limits

You might ask yourself: are other brands as crazy as these guys? We are glad to announce that other companies are doing this as well. Other brand that are striving for full transparency are:

* [Buffer](https://buffer.com/transparency)
* [Everlane](https://www.everlane.com/about)
* (please give us a note if you know of some more transparent brands)
