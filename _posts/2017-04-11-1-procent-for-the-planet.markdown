Both businesses and individuals have a responsibility towards the planet. So, Jaswig needs to take up its responsibility and put its money where its mouth is!

## 1. So Why are we a part of it?

Jaswig can be shaped according to our beliefs and values. We are modeling it in such a way that it is sustainable. We make sure it is viable financially, ecologically and also socially. To uphold the ecological sustainability, we not only wanted to invest in the best possible materials, factories and design but also have a larger impact on the world. And that is why we choose to be a part of [1% for the planet](http://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org/).

## 2. What is 1% for the planet?

[1% for the planet](http://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org/) is an organization that was cofounded by Yvon Chouinard, the founder of the outdoor clothing company [Patagonia](http://eu.patagonia.com/). He is a strong believer that you can use business to do good things for the world. And at Jaswig, we truly reflect on this idea. And that is why all our creations are crafted with love and a vision to create a more sustainable future. 

## 3. Wondering how it works?

Well, it is very simple. We have to give away at least 1% of our annual **annual SALES/REVENUE** to organizations that are a part of the 1% for the planet network. At Jaswig, we are looking out for European initiatives that contribute to reforestation and land protection. This year we are planning to give our funds to [Natuurpunt](http://natuurpunt.be). Natuurpunt is involved in creating a greener Belgium where foliage is disappearing very fast.
