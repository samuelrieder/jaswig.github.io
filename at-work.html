If you want standing desks that will be used by your employees, <a href="mailto:henri@jaswig.eu" target="_blank">drop us a line</a>. <br><br> If you want to get some insights on your own sitting habits, take this 2 minute <a href="/quiz/" target="_blank">sitting questionnaire</a>. <br><br> Also have a look on <a href="/testcube/" target="_blank">our page about the Jaswig TestCube</a>. By setting up this test you can figure out if your company is ready for implementation. This way no major investments have to be done upfront.'
