      <div class="accpanel">
        <p>Jaswig was born out of back and neck pain. Some of us started working, others were still studying. But we all shared the same sitting hours. That’s why we decided to bundle our forces and devise a solution. This was back in 2015, when the first StandUp was designed.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion faq-cta">Jaswig and Fully?</button>
      <div class="accpanel">
        <p>In 2017 we partnered with the B-Corp <a href="https://www.fully.com/" target="_blank">Fully</a>. We broadened our product portfolio with their top products. Next to this, Fully will further assist Jaswig in its goal to get people standing and moving during work. Their 15 years of experience in the furniture market will play a crucial role!</p>

      <button class="accordion faq-cta">1% for the planet?</button>
      <div class="accpanel">
        <p>1% for the planet is an organization that was cofounded by Yvon Chouinard, the founder of the outdoor clothing company Patagonia. He is a strong believer that you can use business to do good things for the world.
          We are part of 1% for the planet which means that 1% of our revenue will go to non profit organizations that are creating a healthier planet.</p>

      <button class="accordion faq-cta">Assembly?</button>
      <div class="accpanel">
        <p>The StandUp is designed for an easy assembly and disassembly. It is part of the design, and what makes it so special “the Jigsaw”. Every StandUp has a manual and a small toolbox, although a power tool is recommended for efficiency.<br><br>
            Within 20 minutes you’ll be standing right at your desired height! We’ve clocked the record at 10’11" ! Or take a look at one of our grandparents preforming the task: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXT4xKsHM-c" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXT4xKsHM-c</a></p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion faq-cta">How do I use it?</button>
      <div class="accpanel">
        <p>The StandUp can be used for individual work: e.g. responding to e-mails, making phone calls while having to write notes (standing up gives more energy in your voice), and heavy thinking (standing can help to be more focused).<br><br>
            The StandUp can mediate collaboration: Have a standing meeting around the StandUp or a more active brainstorming session, like the design team at Balance, Inc.<br><br>
            Sam will show you here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_62yTW0p66g" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_62yTW0p66g</a> how to adjust it in height. Or visit our Instagram page with other customer examples.</p>

        <p>The Cooper will be shipped straight to your desired location. Depending on your location the shipping tariffs will be calculated at the checkout. All the info about shipping can be found under the "Description" tab on the product pages. On the product description page you’ll find the estimated delivery time.

        <p>The Cooper standing desk converter comes fully assembled. This means you can just take it out of the box and start using it right away.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion faq-cta">How do I use it?</button>
      <div class="accpanel">
        <p>The Cooper standing desk converter is a product that transforms the normal height desk you already own (and don't want to get rid of, which is great thinking :)).<br><br>
            So you actually just have to place the Cooper on your desk and there you go, you now have an adjustable standing desk.<br><br>
            An important part of the Cooper is the adjustable gas spring with which you can adjust the resistance/help the spring gives when the desk is moving up and down. For example when you have two screens mounted on your Cooper, there is a lot of weight on it. This means the spring has to give a lot of power when you want to move the desk up as otherwise you have to put that energy into moving it up and down. The adjustable spring makes the process of moving the desk up and down as effortless as possible.<br>
            <img src="/images/6-Cooper-Page/fully-cooper-100185.jpg" alt="Tension Adjustment" width="50%"><br>
            So once you've adjusted the spring for your specific setup, you can adjust the desk in height by pressing the flap on the right side of the Cooper. Once the flap is pressed, you can move the desk up or down to the exact height you want.<br>

      <div class="accpanel">
        <p>All the info about shipping can be found under the "Description" tab on the specific product pages. We try to offer free shipping in Europe but sometimes the rates are so high due to the countries not being in the Europian Union that we have to charge something. We strive to keep them so small as possible because we really see the whole European Union as our market but believe us, it is not as simple as it looks :).</p>

      <button class="accordion faq-cta">Assembly</button>
      <div class="accpanel">
        <p>Most products that we sell that other than the Jarvis, StandUp, Cooper are very simple to assemble. Manuals can be found in the boxes that have been shipped to you.

You can also reach us via the chat session on our homepage within the normal business hours 9am to 5 pm (central European time).</p>
